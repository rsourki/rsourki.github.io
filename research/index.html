	<p>I have worked on multiple topics throughout my studies such as dynamics and vibrations, instabilites, fracture mechanics, design and fabrications. 
  During my PhD I have focused on the processes modelling of textile reinforcements by providing mathematical models, numerical solutions and experimental methods. 
  To do this, I have analytically studied laminates in <b>thermal environments</b> under in-plane compressive forces, and have developed <b>nonlinear material models</b> to identify the material behavior during forming processes. 
  For the experiments, I have designed various experimental rigs to model and determine the out-of-plane and bi-axial behavior of formable and tailorable materials.

  Parallel to my projects, I have worked significantly on various topics in collaboration with various groups and teams.
