	<p>The science and research behind materials and manufacturing continue to grow
	to an extent that the development of technology solutions for structures, designs, robotics, energy, architecture,
	manufacturing and healthcare have become an everyday occurence.
	Today's research in the area of advanced materials and manufacturing is, however, about creating products that 
	are <b>lighter</b>, <b>stronger</b>, <b>smarter</b>, <b>more efficient</b>, and <b>more durable</b>, while minizing the <b>environmental impacts</b> and <b>costs</b>.
	In my journey, I try to utilize my knowledge on mechanics, materials, manufacturing, simulations and data to gain insight into
	what system-level approaches I can take to integrate the emerging materials and manufacturing technologies to be innovative, in which the outcome is  
	add-value product and <b>efficient</b>.</p>
	<p>In my journey, I try to leverege the insights into how <b>nature</b> creates and manufactures to gain inspiration. Throughout this process, I develop 
	computational or data-driven solutions, and utilize a range of mathematical techniques to machine learning to exploit the designs.
	I believe that my knowledge in applied mechanics, mathematics, and computational expertise benefits me in my goal and dreams. This is also possible 
	due to my collaboration with various groups and teams, and that I was involved in many multidisciplinary projects and reserach areas.

	<h2>Previous Works</h2>
	<p>I have worked on multiple topics throughout my studies such as dynamics and vibrations, instabilites, fracture mechanics, design and fabrications. 
  	During my PhD I have focused on the processes modelling of textile reinforcements by providing mathematical models, numerical solutions and experimental methods. 
  	To do this, I have analytically studied laminates in <b>thermal environments</b> under in-plane compressive forces, and have developed <b>nonlinear material models</b> to identify the material behavior during forming processes. 
  	For the experiments, I have designed various experimental rigs to model and determine the out-of-plane and bi-axial behavior of formable and tailorable materials.
  	<br>
  	Parallel to my projects, I have worked significantly on various topics in collaboration with various groups and teams, and was involved in many multidisciplinary projects and reserach areas.
