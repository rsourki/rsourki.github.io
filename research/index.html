	<p>Today's science and research in the area of advanced materials and manufacturing is about creating products that 
	are <b>lighter</b>, <b>stronger</b>, <b>smarter</b>, <b>more efficient</b>, and <b>more durable</b>, while minimizing the <b>environmental impacts</b> and <b>costs</b>.
	In my journey, I try to utilize my knowledge on mechanics, materials, manufacturing, simulations and data to gain insight into
	what approaches I can take to integrate the emerging materials and manufacturing technologies to be innovative, in which the outcome is <b>efficient and can address the demand.</b>.</p>
	<p>I try to leverage the insights into how <b>nature</b> creates and manufactures to gain inspiration. Throughout this process, I develop 
	computational or data-driven solutions, and utilize a range of techniques, from mathematical models to machine learning, to exploit the designs and responses.
	I believe that my knowledge in applied mechanics, mathematics, and computational expertise benefits me in my goal and dreams. It is possible 
	due to my collaborations with various groups and teams. In addition, I was involved in many multidisciplinary projects and research areas.

	<h2 id="previous_work">Previous Works</h2>
	<p>I have worked on multiple topics throughout my studies such as dynamics and vibrations, instabilites, fracture mechanics, design and fabrications. 
  	During my PhD I have focused on the processes modelling of textile reinforcements by providing mathematical models, numerical solutions and experimental methods. 
  	To do this, I have analytically studied laminates in <b>thermal environments</b> under in-plane compressive forces, and have developed <b>nonlinear material models</b> to identify the material behavior during forming processes. 
  	For the experiments, I have designed various experimental rigs to model and determine the out-of-plane and bi-axial behavior of formable and tailorable materials.</p>
	<p>Here, I will concisely demonstrate some of my previous projects.</p>

	<h3 id="viscous">Fractional Derivatives to Provide Improved Viscoelastic Model</h3>
	<img src = "/img/rs_1.jpg"
 	alt = "RS_1" 
 	class = "responsive-img"/>
	<p>The energy dissipation during forming may be rooted in various mechanisms. The viscous nature of composite material components imply that their
	mechanical behavior should be modeled based on the rate of forming. 
	In this project, the viscoelastic behavior of a typical thermoplastic woven fabric was obtained experimentally, and is subsequently modelled based on fractional calculus. 
	The results clearly showed that the viscoelastic moduli of the material, especially at lower temperature regimes, would be more accurately modeled
	through fractional time derivatives.</p>

	<h3 id="vibration_analysis">Vibration Analysis & Vibration Suppression: Structural Health Monitoring</h3>
	<img src = "/img/rs_2.jpg"

 	class = "responsive-img"/>
	<p>Vibration phenomena remains as one of the most important structural analysis and characterization method. This analysis shows its importance specifically in structural health monitoring applications. 
	We have studied the vibration behavior of sturctures that are in severe conditions, e.g. in thermal environment, or having defects such as cracks. 
	The results clearly showed that we can actively suppress the natural modes of structures, and reduce the risk of interior damages, i.e. edge cracks, interlaminar cracks and voids by exploiting the loadings and the geometry.</p>

	<h3 id="fracture_analysis">Fracture Analysis of Mediums</h3>
	<img src = "/img/rs_3.jpg"
 	alt = "RS_3" 
 	class = "responsive-img"/>
	<p>Fracture mechanics is concerned with the propogation of cracks in materials. Fracture analysis of materials is an important area, especially on soft materials including elastomers and gels that are pervasive in technological application, 
	in which are susceptible to tear due to their low fracture energies. The prediction of fracture energy and crack-tip strain field as well as stress intesity factors
	are still challending in many materials. There are many methods to model such defects.
	Here, we have used analytical approaches to find some of the answers on predicting crack growth in mediums.
	Our results show that crack propogation is sensitive to the relative alignment between the crack and the material,
	crack length, crack configurations, and the speed of the moving cracks.</p>
