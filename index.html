	<p>Hello and Welcome! I am a current Ph.D Candidate, UGF Graduate Fellow, and Mitacs Accelerate Fellow in Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/"> The University of British Columbia (UBC)</a>. 
         I am currently a visiting research fellow in <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/">School of Enginnering and Applied Sciences</a> at <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a> working with Professor <a href="https://bertoldi.seas.harvard.edu/">Katia Bertoldi</a>.
        <br>In my Ph.D., I am advised by Professor <a href="https://engineering.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/abbas-milani/">Abbas Milani</a> and Professor <a href="https://www.civil.ubc.ca/faculty/reza-vaziri">Reza Vaziri</a> in Composites and Optimization group focusing on the in-plane and out-of-plane fabric behavior during forming processes.
         I recieved my B.Sc. & M.Sc. with honors from <a href="http://www.znu.ac.ir/engineering/en/"> University of Zanjan</a> and <a href="https://aut.ac.ir/en">Amirkabir University of Technology</a> advised by Professor <a href="http://mec.aut.ac.ir/autcms/people/verticalPagesAjax/professorHomePage.htm?url=fariborz&depurl=mechanical-engineering&lang=en&cid=1953">Shahriar J. Fariborz</a>.
        <br>
	<br>
	My research aims to develop a theoretical and numerical methods to design and optimize meta-materials, currently focused on meta-fabrics. 
        Further, I aim to predict the behavior and the 3D-shape of complex materials during manufacturing processes with the current focus on pre-preg woven fabrics. 
        To do so, I have designed many advanced experimental set-ups and fixtures to capture the specific behavior of such materials under various deformation modes, i.e. in-plane and out-of-plane deformations.
	I have focused on using tools from <b>FE simulations</b>, and <b>machine learning</b>.</p>
