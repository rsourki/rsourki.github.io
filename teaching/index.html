  <h2>Teaching Experiences</h2>
  <p>I have been very lucky to have several teaching opportunities throughout my studies teaching undergraduate and graduate courses. 
  I have been recognized by the School of Engineering as an outstanding teacher assistant and was nominated by School of Engineering for the Provost Award for Teacher Assistants and Tutors 
  and had the student evaluation rating as high as 4.9/5.0.

  <h3>APSC 171: Engineering Drawing and CAD/CAM</h3>
  <p>I acted as the TA for the course APSC 171 (Engineering Drawing and CAD/CAM) and taught students both in class lectures and in tutorial how to use CAD/CAM software to
    create their novel ideas and how to exploit the features of CAD/CAM software to have an efficient and yet accurate design. 
    In this course, 4 (out of 7) of my groups made it to the finals and 3 teams made it to the top 10 teams (out of 60+ teams). 
    I had an outstanding feedback from my students, and was rated as an excellent TA.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>APSC 258: Aplications of Engineering Design</h3>
  <p>I acted as the TA for this course which is one of the most challenging second year courses in UBC's undergraduate curriculum.
    I was able to teach students how to make hovercrafts and provided them the knowledge regarding various aspects of engineering design throughout the lab and tutorial sessions. 
    In my class, 3 (out of 6) of the groups made it to the final competition. I was rated as an excellent TA in both of my lectures and laboratory sessions by my students repeatedly.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>ENGR 492/582: Finite Element Method & CIVIL 537: Computational Mechanics I</h3>
  <p>In a cross-numbered (graduate/undergraduate) course ENGR 492/582 (Finite Element Method), I took the leadership to provide weekly sessions for graduate and undergraduate students on the course material.
  Additionally, I worked on the course CIVL 537, by providing assignments, midterms and assistantship to the instructor.</p>
